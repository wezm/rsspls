`rsspls` generates RSS feeds from web pages. Example use cases:

* Create a feed for a blog that does not have one so that you will know when there are new posts.
* Create a feed from the search results on real estate agent's website so that you know when there are
  new listings—without having to check manually all the time.
* Create a feed of the upcoming tour dates of your favourite band or DJ.
* Create a feed of the product page for a company, so you know when new products are added.

The idea is that you will then subscribe to the generated feeds in you feed reader. This will typically
require the feeds to be hosted via a web server. 

Download
--------

Pre-compiled binaries are available for a number of platforms.
They require no additional dependencies on your computer.

* [FreeBSD 13 amd64](https://releases.wezm.net/rsspls/0.1.2/rsspls-0.1.2-amd64-unknown-freebsd.tar.gz)
* [Linux x86\_64](https://releases.wezm.net/rsspls/0.1.2/rsspls-0.1.2-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz)
* [MacOS x86\_64](https://releases.wezm.net/rsspls/0.1.2/rsspls-0.1.2-x86_64-apple-darwin.tar.gz)
* [Windows x86\_64](https://releases.wezm.net/rsspls/0.1.2/rsspls-0.1.2-x86_64-pc-windows-msvc.zip)

Example to download and extract a binary:

    curl https://releases.wezm.net/rsspls/0.1.2/rsspls-0.1.2-x86_64-unknown-linux-musl.tar.gz | tar zxf -

This will result in the `rsspls` binary in the current directory.

Usage
-----

### Configuration

Unless specfifed via the `--config` command line option
`rsspls` reads its configuration from `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/rsspls/feeds.toml`.
If `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is unset it defaults to `~/.config/rsspls/feeds.toml`.
The configuration file is in [TOML][toml] format.

The parts of the page to extract for the feed are specified using [CSS selectors][selectors].

#### Annotated Sample Configuration

The sample file below demonstrates all the parts of the configuration.

```toml
# The configuration must start with the [rsspls] section
[rsspls]
# Optional output directory to write the feeds to. If not specified it must be supplied via
# the --output command line option.
output = "/tmp"

# Next is the array of feeds, each one starts with [[feed]]
[[feed]]
# The title of the channel in the feed
title = "My Great RSS Feed"
# The output filename without the output directory to write this feed to.
# Note: this is a filename only, not a path. It should not contain slashes.
filename = "wezm.rss"

# The configuration for the feed
[feed.config]
# The URL of the web page to generate the feed from.
url = "https://www.wezm.net/"
# A CSS selector to select elements on the page that represent items in the feed.
item = "article"
# A CSS selector relative to `item` to an element that will supply the title and link for the item.
# Note: This element must have a `href` attribute.
heading = "h3 a"
# Optional CSS selector relative to `item` that will supply the content of the RSS item.
summary = ".post-body"
# Optional CSS selector relative to `item` that supples the publication date of the RSS item.
date = "time[datetime]"

# A second example feed
[[feed]]
title = "Mint Blog"
filename = "mint.rss"

[feed.config]
url = "https://mint-lang.com/blog"
item = ".posts-small .post-small"
heading = "a"
# summary = this page doesn't have one
date = "small"
```

### Hosting

It is expected that `rsspls` will be run on a web server that is serving the directory the feeds
are written to. `rsspls` just generates the feeds, it's not a server. In order to have the feeds
update you will need to arrange for `rsspls` to be run periodically. You might do this with [cron],
[systemd timers][timers], or the Windows equivalent.

### Caveats

`rsspls` just fetches and parses the HTML of the web page you specify. It does not run JavaScript.
If the website is entirely generated by JavaScript (such as Twitter) then `rsspls` will not work.

Build from Source
-----------------

**Minimum Supported Rust Version:** 1.58.0

`rsspls` is implemented in Rust. See the Rust website for [instructions on
installing the toolchain][rustup].

### From Git Checkout or Release Tarball
